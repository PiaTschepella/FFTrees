## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed automated references from "http://doi.org/" to "https://doi.org/" (to fix invalid URLs). 


## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 4.0.5 
* macOS builder, R version 4.2.1 Patched 
* win-builder (devel, oldrelease, release) 
* Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit 
* Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC 
* Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran 


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE: The new maintainer name/contact info (Hansjoerg Neth <h.neth@uni.kn>) is correct, 
as confirmed in email from previous maintainer (Nathaniel Phillips <nathaniel.d.phillips.is@gmail.com>) to CRAN (<cran-submissions@r-project.org>) on 2022-08-30, 18:27 CEST. See also <https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees/issues/70>. 

The remaining "(possibly) invalid URLs" are valid.


## Downstream dependencies

* None.
