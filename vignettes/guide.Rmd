## Fast-and-Frugal Trees (FFTs) 

<!-- Defining FFTs: -->

A _fast-and-frugal tree_ (FFT) [@martignon2003naive] is a set of hierarchical rules for making decisions based on very little pieces of information (usually\ 4 or fewer cues). 
Specifically, it is a decision tree where each node has exactly 2\ branches, where one (or in the cast of the final node, both) branches is an exit branch. 

FFTs are simple, transparent decision strategies that use minimal information to make decisions [see @gigerenzer1999fast;@gigerenzer1999good]. 
They are frequently preferable to more complex decision strategies (such as logistic regression, LR) because they rarely over-fit data [@gigerenzer2009homo] and are easy to interpret and implement in real-world decision tasks [@marewski2012heuristic]. 
FFTs have been used in real world tasks from detecting depression [@jenny2013simple], to making fast decisions in emergency rooms [@green1997alters].

<!-- FFTrees package: -->

The **FFTrees** package makes it easy to produce, display, and evaluate FFTs [@phillips2017FFTrees]. 
The package's main function is `FFTrees()` which takes formula\ `formula` and dataset\ `data` arguments and returns several FFTs that attempt to classify training cases into criterion classes. 
The FFTs created can then be used to predict new data to cross-validate their performance. 

Here is an example of fitting `FFTrees()` to `heart.train` data and applying a resulting FFT to `heart.test` data: 

```{r fig-1, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6.5, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="A fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) to predict heart disease status."}
# Create a fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) predicting heart disease:
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heart.train,
                     data.test = heart.test,
                     main = "Heart Disease",
                     decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Diseased"))

# Visualize the best training tree applied to test data:
plot(heart.fft, data = "test")
```

## How to use the FFTrees package

To get started with **FFTrees**, we recommend studying the [Heart Disease Tutorial](FFTrees_heart.html). 
This tutorial will take you through all of the basics steps of creating, visualising, and evaluating fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs).

## Datasets

The package contains several datasets taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) that you can use to play around with **FFTrees**: 

- `heartdisease` -- Patients suspected of having heart disease [source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- `breastcancer` -- Patients suspected of having breast cancer [source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- `titanic` -- Passengers on the Titanic
- `forestfires` -- Forest fire statistics [source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires)
- `wine` -- Ratings of wine quality [source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)
- `income` -- Census data from > 30,000 US residents [source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)
- `voting` -- 1984 US congressional voting records [source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records)


## Article and citation information

We had a lot of fun creating **FFTrees** and hope you like it too! 
As a comprehensive, but understandable introduction to FFTs, we recommend reading our article in the journal _Judgment and Decision Making_ ([2017, volume\ 12, issue\ 4](`r url_JDM_issue`)), entitled _FFTrees: A toolbox to create, visualize,and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees_ (available in [html](`r url_JDM_html`) | [PDF](`r url_JDM_pdf`)\ ).
