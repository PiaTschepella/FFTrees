## Fast-and-Frugal Trees (FFTs) 

<!-- Defining FFTs: -->

A _fast-and-frugal tree_ (FFT) [@martignon2003naive] is a set of hierarchical rules for solving binary classification tasks based on very little pieces of information (usually\ 4 or fewer cues). 
In contrast to more complex decision trees, each node of an FFT has exactly two branches, where at least one branch is an exit branch (and both branches of the final nodes are exits). 

<!-- Characteristics and benefits of FFTs: -->

FFTs are simple and effective decision strategies that use minimal information for making decisions in binary classification problems [see @gigerenzer1999fast;@gigerenzer1999good]. 
FFTs are often preferable to more complex decision strategies (such as logistic regression, LR) because they rarely over-fit data [@gigerenzer2009homo] and are easy to interpret, implement, and communicate in real-world settings [@marewski2012heuristic]. 
FFTs have been designed to tackle many real world tasks from making fast decisions in emergency rooms [@green1997alters] to detecting depression [@jenny2013simple]. 

<!-- Emphasize transparency: -->

Whereas their performance and success are empirical questions, a key theoretical advantage of FFTs is their _transparency_ to decision makers and anyone aiming to understand and evaluate the details of an algorithm. 
In the words of @burton2020, "human users could interpret, justify, control, and interact with a fast-and-frugal decision aid" (p.\ 229). 


## Using the FFTrees package

The **FFTrees** package makes it easy to produce, display, and evaluate FFTs [@phillips2017FFTrees]. 
The package's main function is `FFTrees()` which takes formula\ `formula` and dataset\ `data` arguments and returns several FFTs that attempt to classify training cases into criterion classes. 
The FFTs created can then be used to predict new data to cross-validate their performance. 

Here is an example of fitting `FFTrees()` to `heart.train` data and applying a resulting FFT to `heart.test` data: 

```{r fig-1, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6.5, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="A fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) to predict heart disease status."}
# Create a fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) predicting heart disease:
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heart.train,
                     data.test = heart.test,
                     main = "Heart Disease",
                     decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Diseased"))

# Visualize the best training tree applied to test data:
plot(heart.fft, data = "test")
```

## Getting started 

To begin using the **FFTrees** package, we recommend studying the [Heart Disease Tutorial](FFTrees_heart.html). 
This tutorial will take you through all of the basics steps of creating, visualizing, and evaluating fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs). 
The scientific background of FFTs and the development of **FFTrees** are described in @phillips2017FFTrees ()
