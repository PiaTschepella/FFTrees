# FFTrees

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ndphillips/FFTrees.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ndphillips/FFTrees)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/FFTrees)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FFTrees)
[![Rdoc](http://www.rdocumentation.org/badges/version/FFTrees)](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/FFTrees)

The goal of FFTrees is to create and visualize fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) like the one below that predicts heart disease.

## Installation

You can install the released version of FFTrees from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("FFTrees")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ndphillips/FFTrees")
```
## Examples

```{r example, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, out.width = "80%"}
# Load package
library(FFTrees)

# Create an FFTrees object from the heartdisease data
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~., 
                     data = heart.train,
                     data.test = heart.test, 
                     decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Disease"))

# See the print method
heart.fft

# Plot the best tree applied to the test data
plot(heart.fft,
     data = "test",
     main = "Heart Disease")

# Create your own custom FFT 'in words' and apply it to data

# Create my own fft
my.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~., 
                  data = heart.train,
                  data.test = heart.test, 
                  decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Disease"),
                  my.tree = "If sex = 1, predict Disease.
                             If age < 45, predict Healthy.
                             If thal = {fd, normal}, predict Disease. 
                             Otherwise, predict Healthy")


# See the print method
heart.fft

# Plot my custom fft and see how it did
plot(my.fft,
     data = "test",
     main = "Custom FFT")
```
